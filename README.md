# Automating Decision Making

## Problem
I wanted to prepare for my upcoming "Mechanics of Solids 2" final exam by completing workshop problems. The final exam could cover all content from weeks 1-10 (excluding week 6). Thus, it seemed like a good idea to randomize the questions in a similar fashion to how they would appear on the test. 

## Solution
I used the "random" library to produce a random week and a random question. This allowed to me to acheive my goal of attempting questions in a manner that would mimic my upcoming exam.

## Operation
1. Open the file in an IDE that supports python.
2. Run the program to produce a single week and single question.
3. Run the program again once the question has been completed.
